# If you had to do it again, Would you go the same route? 

I think if I could of taken CS classes in college I would, but appreciate my real life work experience I obtained prior to switching to code. 

I also think I would still do Bloc again since I did have a [successful outcome](https://github.com/bdougie/ama/blob/master/was-bloc-worth-it.md).
