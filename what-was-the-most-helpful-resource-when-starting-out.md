# What was the most helpful resource you used while starting out?

Twitter was the best resource for me when starting out. I know probably not the answer you were looking for...maybe, but when I first started out I began stalking anyone and everyone who was in a position where I wanted to be (a programmer). I spent a good amount of time just reading their blog post and watching their streams to get an idea of what made them good t what they do.

I still do this today when I begin learning a new language or framework. If you don't have a twitter, set one up today and also do the same with github(follow them on github).
