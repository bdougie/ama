During the short time I have been at this I have had a number of mentors, some I only had the opportunity to chat with once. It is definitely hard to get some one to meet with you on a regular basis, which is why I recommend impromptu/unofficial meetings. 

This might be weird, but I would approach the idea of mentorship the way society does dating. If its an in person mentor, I recommend just chatting over coffee without laptops, pick their brain.

Most people I would consider as mentors I have been in contact via online. Mainly from the amount of exposure I try to keep. Most devs out there are like the rest of us, and most are willing to help if you reach out. 

I have multiple mentors, people I would say are invested in my success as a dev. I wouldn’t say this is common, my current CTO is probably the closest thing to a mentor I have. He meets with me regularly and provides feedback on my learning outside of work, he even provides books and extra reading as well. 

When I started learning GO and Ember specifically, I jumped into the community pretty hard. I joined slack groups and read tons of blog post to educate myself on them. I eventually met some pretty influential people in both communities that have helped me tremendously in learning both. 

I met both almost by accident, but more so just by being vocal about what I was learning next. An Ember dev I was pairing with regularly offers a similar service to what I am doing with [Mutualfun](http://Mutualfun.io), called http://pair.withassociates.com/

I also am apart of a community here [apprenticeship.community](https://apprenticeship.community/), which I was unaware prior to moving but the majority of them live here in Oakland, but available online.

I don’t know of specific people available to be mentors, but I am pretty sure if you just put yourself out there you will be amazed to see the amount of people willing to help. 

At the very least, I highly recommend joining the Apprenticeship Community
