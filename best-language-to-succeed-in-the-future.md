# What language do you think will give me the best opportunity succeed in the future?

I truly believe Ruby is not going anywhere especially and partial to it as was the first language I could actually write and do things with. Picking the best  language really depends on your interests, For example if you have plans to get involved in web development knowing Ruby will help you a lot as well as knowing javascript.
 
jQuery is super easy to learn and works similar to css. but I am not sure if your goal is web. The problem is jQuery is it can make projects a pain to work with as they grow and a lot of forward thinking companies are moving away from. 

TL;DR - I would learn javascript next with this [book](http://eloquentjavascript.net/).

You didn't mention Rails in your question but I'll assume you have some exposure to it. Again I highly recommend learning Javascript next and really getting to understand it. I also recommend using a framework but only after you read this [book](http://eloquentjavascript.net/), just to get your hands into the syntax and how it works. 

There are issues with learning a JS frame work, mainly due to the amount of them that are out in the wild, so I recommend learning a fully featured framework like Ember or Meteor (I wouldn't learn Angular until 2.0 comes out). Learning a fully feature framework will give you a lot of tools and tutorials to learn from and help you understand the basics. I would be weary in learning React as newbie, only because it is constantly changing and most likely hard to grasp as newer individual to code. Once you get a good understanding of Meteor or Ember I recommend  checking out basic Javascript similar to do similar things you do in basic Ruby. This will help you understand higher level programming and how similar things are.

I made a lot of assumptions so let me know if I was way off. Also I am gauging "successful" as the ability to learn quickly and learn more things quicker, you could truly successful if you learned more Ruby and maybe some jQuery. Once you have ruby and javascript learned it will be easier to try out new things and languages. I mentioned in a [podcast episode](http://developingstory.netlify.com/tds-07-programming-pastime) that my goal is to be strong in four languages which is the basis for my answer.
