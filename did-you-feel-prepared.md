# Did you feel prepared when job hunting for your first programming job

I detailed this on my blog and will link that [here](http://theblackc000000de.blogspot.com/search?q=interview), but I basically sucked it up and just interviewed. I had a job and wasn't really desperate for a new one, I just wanter a new one. Having that attitude help me through the challenging interviews and still learn a ton from the jobs I did not get.
