# What was your experience in coding prior to going through Bloc?

My experience prior to bloc was literally the [One Month Rails](https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails/) course, That was the only thing I actually completed. So I literally had about a month of experience/trying things before I signed up with Bloc. I found out about them pretty early on in my learning and gave myself a chance try learning on my own first.I started CodeAcademy, and some other tutorials but basically just watched youtube and Udemy videos without doing any of the work. 

I wrote a blog post about what I recommend to do before you decide on bloc, if you want to [check it out](http://theblackc000000de.blogspot.com/2014/05/do-this-before-you-bloc.html). I completed the Rails/Full Stack course, but it can be applied to Front End and Javascript if you know of any of those tutorials. 

I struggled with finishing things and Bloc kind of broke that for me. After Bloc I went back and finish Codecademy and a ton of other tutorials. 

To answer your second question, Bloc did not help me find a job. I started Bloc in 2013, just barely over a year after they started altogether and their focus was only on the FullStack curriculum and the mentorship. During the 3 months I was going through the program they announced the 3 new tracks, Design, Front-End, and iOS. I am pretty sure Android came just as I was finishing too, but not sure. The Job Prep stuff did not come until a month after I was hired, which was about 6 weeks after Bloc, I was in Sales at the time and was promoted twice Making the same(more with a bonus) I make now, which is why I waited a month to really decide whether or not I wanted to do this. 

So it is completely possible to get a job on your own after Bloc, but I have viewed their material and Job Help program and recommend it. 

I wrote to blog post to explain more on what I did to get hired: [What I did different](http://theblackc000000de.blogspot.com/2014/05/what-i-did-different.html) && [Hired in 29 weeks](http://theblackc000000de.blogspot.com/2014/05/hired-in-week-29.html)

My biggest recommendation is making friends in the developer community. I am amazed at the level of talented friends I have and the opportunities it has led me to.
